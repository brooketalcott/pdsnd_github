### Credits
Thanks to Kevin for [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23294658/asking-the-user-for-input-until-they-give-a-valid-response/23294659#23294659) thorough answer on user prompts and validation.

I also really appreciated [this](https://matthew-brett.github.io/teaching/string_formatting.html) blog post from matthew-brett on different methods to insert variables into strings in Python. I missed template string literals from JavaScript and was super happy to know there is now a similar option in Python.

```
person = 'Brooke'
print(f'{person} is happy about it.')
```
`> Brooke is happy about it.`
